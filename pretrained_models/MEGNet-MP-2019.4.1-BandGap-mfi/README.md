# Aim

This model is a multif-fidelity MEGNet band gap model for 89 elements of the periodic table. It contains the band gap
for most of materials with 4 fidelities ("0": PBE, "1": GLLB-SC, "2": HSE, "3": SCAN). This is essentially a retrained
version of the MEGNet band gap model originally implemented in tensorflow.
