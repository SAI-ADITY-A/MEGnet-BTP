# Aim

This model is a M3GNet universal potential for 89 elements of the periodic table. It has broad applications in the
dynamic simulations of materials. This is essentially a retrained version of the M3GNet universal potential originally
implemented in tensorflow. It should be noted that the structures with high forces (> 100 eV/A) and no bond are removed
in the dataset.
