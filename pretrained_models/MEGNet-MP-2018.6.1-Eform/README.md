# Aim

This model is a MEGNet formation energy model for 89 elements of the periodic table. It contains the formation
energy for most of materials. This is essentially a retrained version of the MEGNet formation energy model
originally implemented in tensorflow.

# Training dataset

MP-2018.6.1: Materials Project formation energy as of 2018.6.1.

Number of structures for training: 62315

Number of structures for validation: 3461

Number of structures for testing: 3463

# Performance metrics

The reported numbers are mean absolute error of formation energy in eV/atom.

Train: 0.010 eV/atom

Valid: 0.029 eV/atom

Test: 0.028 eV/atom
