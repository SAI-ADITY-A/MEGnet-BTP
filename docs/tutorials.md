# Tutorials

A series of [Jupyter notebooks][jupyternb] have been written to demonstrate the capabilities of MatGL. The following 
is a recommended sequence of nicely formatted notebooks autogenerated via nbconvert for easier reading.

## Basic Usage

This series of notebooks demonstrate how to load and use the pretrained models for property predictions.
 
1. [Property Predictions using MEGNet or M3GNet Models](tutorials%2FProperty%20Predictions%20using%20MEGNet%20or%20M3GNet%20Models.html)
2. [Relaxations and Simulations using the M3GNet Universal Potential](tutorials%2FRelaxations%20and%20Simulations%20using%20the%20M3GNet%20Universal%20Potential.html)
3. [Combining the M3GNet Universal Potential with Property Prediction Models](tutorials%2FCombining%20the%20M3GNet%20Universal%20Potential%20with%20Property%20Prediction%20Models.html)

## Large scale benchmarking

1. [Benchmarking M3GNet Predictions of Cubic Lattice Parameters](tutorials%2FBenchmarking%20M3GNet%20Predictions%20of%20Cubic%20Lattice%20Parameters.html)

## Training MatGL models
